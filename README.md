# Rust crawler
Simple rust crawler that takes in a seed url, and keywords to find inside of websites. Useful for finding keywords for OSINT or just finding stuff. Doesn't work with Javascript based websites built on React or any other frameworks. Doesn't have a captcha bypass. Doesn't respect robots.txt yet.
